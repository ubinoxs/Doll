                <strong>
                    "Is it my little squirrel bustling about?"
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    "My little spendthrift, we can&#39;t spend money recklessly."
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    "You&#39;re a funny little creature. Just like your father. Always on the lookout for money."
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 30pt;">
                Torvald address at Nora using terms like "little squirrel," "little spendthrift," and "little creature." These terms emphasize on the word "little," which suggests that from Torvald&#39; perspective, Nora is weak, dependent, and needs protection from a bigger, stronger identity, which is him. Torvald also calls Nora with animal&#39;s name, like "squirrel" and "skylark." Finally, Torvald talks to Nora using a preachy tone, like "we can't spend money recklessly." These evidence shows that Torvald treats Nora as if she is a child, indicating that Torvald is arrogant in their relationship, and lacks enough respect to his partner.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    "My darling wife, I don&#39; feel as if I could hold you tight enough. Do you know, Nora, I have often wished that you might be threatened by some great danger, so that I might risk my life&#39; blood, and everything, for your sake."
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    "I would gladly work night and day for you, Nora -- bear sorrow and want for your sake."
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 30pt;">
                Torvald showcases a strong willingness to protect Nora from danger. However, when he realizes Nora is truly in danger as he reads the letter, he became mad at Nora because his reputation is threatened, which is more important to him than Nora is&#39;s safety. This shows that Torvald&#39;s words "I might risk my life's blood, and everything, for your sake" is not true. One the one hand, this indicates that Torvald considers his own reputation as his priority, instead of Nora; on the other hand, Torvald may have overestimated his affection to Nora - he thinks that he loves Nora more than he actually does.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>
                    "Now you have ruined my entire happiness, you have destroyed my whole future."
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    "But no man would sacrifice his honour for the one he loves."
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 30pt;">
                Torvald's love for Nora is conditional. He loves Nora when his first priority, which is his honour, is afe, and when Nora is fulfilling the role of an ideal wife - in other words, when Nora is following the social expectation. He would love Nora when these two conditions are met; on the contrary, he would stop loving Nora when his own reputation is threatened or when Nora is not following the social expectation. One interesting thing is that "Nora loves him" is not necessarly a condition for Torvald to love Nora. When he reads the letter, he realizes two things: (1) Nora loves him, (2) His reputation is in danger. His reaction clearly indicates that he only cares about (2), and (1) is only taken into consideration once he realizes the threat has vanished.

        <!-- Second section -->
        <div class="section">
            <p class="subtitle">Torvald as a Father</p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    "Almost everyone who has gone to the bad early in life has had a deceitful mother."
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    "All your father&#39;s recklessness and instability he has handed on to you!"
                </strong>
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30pt;">
                Torvald thinks children's characteristcs are mainly shaped by two factors: (1) influence from their mother and (2) genetic inheirtance. Torvald seems to consider father's influence on children to be minimal. As a result, he rarely spends time with the children and sees parenting as Nora's responsibility.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>
                    “The place will only be bearable for a mother now!”
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    “It&#39;s a sweet little spendthrift, but she uses up a great deal of money.”
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 30pt;">
                Torvald also seems to be uninterested in his children. In the first sentence, he seems to consider children as "unbearable". In the second setence, he returns the topic back to Nora and himself once Nora starts to talk about the children, showing a clear lack of interest in the children.

        <!-- Third section -->
        <div class="section">
            <p class="subtitle">Torvald as a Worker</p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    “I&#39;ve been appointed manager of the Bank.”
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    “But during the first year he over-worked himself dreadfully. You see, he had to make money every way he could, and he worked early and late; but he couldn&#39;t stand it, and fell dreadfully ill, and the doctors said it was necessary for him to go south”
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 30pt;">
                From Nora, we know that Torvald worked so hard in the first year of his career that he over-worked and fell ill. One year of hard work proves that Torvald is not only hard-working, but also persistent. Torvald is promoted to be the manager of the bank within only one year, which further emphasize Torvald's great performance in the workplace. Therefore, we can analyze that, as a worker, Torvald is delligent and persistent. We may further imply that Torvald is career-oriented.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    “The fact is, he was a college chum of mine—there was one of those rash friendships between us that one so often repents of later. I may as well tell you plainly, we are on Christian name terms. And that tactless fellow lays no restraint on himself when other people are present. On the contrary, he thinks it gives him the right to adopt an intimate tone with me, and every minute it is &#39;I say, Helmer, old fellow!&#39; and that sort of thing. I assure you it is extremely painful for me. He would make my position in the bank intolerable.”
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 30pt;">
                The biggest reason Torvald is firing Krogstad is actually that Krogstad addresses at Torvald and talks to Torvald over intimately in the workplace, which is not good for Torvald's authority and social status. For his own sake, Torvald decides to fire Krogstad, despte Krogstad's hard effort to improve his life. This shows that Torvald is self-centered and unempathetic as a worker.
